derivco-game-jam-the-unkown

This was a small game that I made within 16 hours during the Derivco Game Jam event at Nelson Mandela University in 2015. 

In this game I tried to create a 2D arena survival game with where the player needed to survive incoming waves of enemies. 
Unfortunately in the small amount of time I was only able to get some of the mechanics working.
